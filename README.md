# NoSQL - Social Media API
This is part of Challenge 18 - NoSQL Social Media API for my UT Bootcamp Full Stack program.

## Built With
This application was built with MongoDB and Express. There was no starter code for this project.

## How to Run the Code
Follow these steps below to use the application:
1. Clone the Repo
2. Install dependencies using '$ npm install' in the command line
3. Run '$npm start'
4. Test your routes in Insomnia
**NOTE:** Please add a .gitignore file and node_modules to that if you plan on committing to your repo.

## Contributions
This was largely an indendent project. I'm actually very proud I was able to take what was in the lesson and documentation to make this work.

## Observations and Challenges
I have a horrible habit of changing things for style. Example: Friends instead of friends. When I need to reference Friends I was typing friends. So that made it not work. Yes, my code would break because of a capitalized letter. Becuase I wanted it to be more formal. That's a habit I'm going to shake.
